Create product titles by starting with the Brand Name or License Name if applicable, followed by the Style Name. Include Descriptive Features such as the clothing top style, character, sports league/team, or material to provide detailed information. Next, specify the Apparel Style and Clothing Type, mention the Count Per Pack, and optionally add the Clothing Size Group in parentheses.
